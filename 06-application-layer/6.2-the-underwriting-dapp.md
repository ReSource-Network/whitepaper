# 6.2 The Underwriting dApp

The Underwriting dApp features three main functions:

**The Opportunity Feed,** to which application details of all new potential members are broadcasted. On this feed, Underwriters can overview all new applicants; access relevant information, such as credit scores and financial statements; and place bids.

**The Portfolio Manager**, on which Underwriters manage their underwritten accounts. Here underwritten accounts can be packaged into Staking Pools, which will then be automatically offered to Delegating Stakers via the Pool Aggregator.
