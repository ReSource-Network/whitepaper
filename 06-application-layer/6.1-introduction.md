# 6.1 Introduction

The interaction of Protocol agents with each other and with the Protocolâ€™s code base is facilitated by a series of decentralized Web3 applications.

The **Underwriting dApp** allows Underwriters to find new applicants, analyze their credit risk, place corresponding bids, and repackage the accounts of underwritten members into Staking Pools.

The **Pool Aggregator** allows SOURCE holders to study and select Staking Pools created by Underwriters, stake their SOURCE, and collect staking rewards.

The **Ambassador** **dApp** allows Ambassadors to onboard new members, track the activity of existing members affiliated with them, and intervene if suboptimal activity or nearing defaults are detected.

On the **ReSource Debt Market,** third parties can participate in Dutch auctions in which the legal rights to uncollectible accounts are being sold.

Finally, the **ReSource Marketplace** allows members to trade with each other, manage their listings, and access their rUSD and SOURCE holdings, using the accompanying secured wallet application.
