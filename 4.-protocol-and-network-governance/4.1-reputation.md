Each participant in the ReSource Network may gain Reputation points when acting in ways deemed beneficial to the network, and lose them when displaying unwanted behaviours. However, more than an incentive mechanism and measure of desired behaviour, Reputation measures a participant’s stake in the network, their dependence on it, and their alignment of interest with it.&#x20;
