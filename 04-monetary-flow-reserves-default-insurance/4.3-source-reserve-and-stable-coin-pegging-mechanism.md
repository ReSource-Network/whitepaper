# 4.3 SOURCE Reserve and Stable Coin Pegging Mechanism

In the protocol implementation described in this paper, rUSD never leaves the trading network and is not listed on external exchanges. In this scenario, the only way for members to export value from within the trading network to the open market is to convert their rUSD to SOURCE via the network’s Reserve, as elaborated on in more detail in the chapters below.

Such an arrangement has the obvious upside of simplifying the network’s monetary dynamics. The export of value via rUSD to SOURCE conversions can be tightly regulated to support the health of the trading network, while rUSD’s peg to the US dollar is cost effectively achieved by the following factors:

1. The rUSD supply matches the demand exercised on it by outstanding debt.
2. rUSD deficits convert 1:1 into debt denominated in US dollars if not paid in time.
3. rUSD surpluses can, under certain conditions, be converted into a liquid asset (SOURCE) at the pegging price ($1)

This “carrot and stick” arrangement organically drives members to regard their rUSD balances, positive as well as negative ones, as akin to USD balances, and consequently to price their goods and services within the network accordingly.
