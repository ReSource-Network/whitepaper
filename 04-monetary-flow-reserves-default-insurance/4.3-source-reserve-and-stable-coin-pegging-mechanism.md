# 4.3 RSD Savings Accounts

Holders of positive RSD balances will be offered RSD savings plans. RSD deployed into saving plans remains spendable and is not subject to any form lock up period.&#x20;

RSD deployed into savings plans accrues SOURCE rewards which stem from transaction fees paid by members. In return for these rewards, RSD savers carry a portion of the network’s credit risk.&#x20;

In case of a default among ReSource members, demurrage charges  will be levied on RSD savers to recover the lost debt, remove excess RSD from circulation and restore monetary equilibrium. The required demurrage charges which will be imposed on RSD savers in proportion to their risk settings and savings amount.

#### SOURCE Reimbursements&#x20;

&#x20;On top of consecutive SOURCE rewards (stemming from transaction fees), RSD savers will also be eligible for SOURCE reimbursements. Each RSD demurrage debit will be accompanied by a SOURCE reimbursement, paid on top of consecutive SOURCE rewards. These reimbursements are sourced from Underwriter/Ambassador stakes which have been confiscated due to the member’s default that made the demurrage charge necessary.
