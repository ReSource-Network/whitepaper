# 4.5	Monetary Buffering

It is important to note that fee payments and staking requirements are both facilitated via SOURCE payments but denominated in rUSD. For example, a member might be obligated to pay a 3% transaction fee. This fee is denominated in rUSD but will be paid in SOURCE. In other words, a 100 rUSD transaction will entail a 3 rUSD fee, which will be paid in SOURCE.

If the current SOURCE price is 3cUSD, one SOURCE will be consumed by the transaction. If the price of SOURCE drops to 1 SOURCE=1cUSD, 3 SOURCE will be consumed by the transaction, etc.

Likewise, staking requirements are denominated in rUSD. If an Underwriter is, for example, obligated to stake 20% of a credit line’s maximum overdraft amount, they would be required to stake 200 rUSD worth of SOURCE to underwrite a credit line of up to 1000 rUSD—for example, 100 SOURCE if 1 SOURCE=2 rUSD. Consequently, if the price of SOURCE rises above 2 rUSD, the staking contract will pay out the excess SOURCE as staking rewards until the locked SOURCE equals 200 rUSD again. Vice versa, if the SOURCE price sinks below 2 rUSD, the staking contract will withhold staking rewards until locked SOURCE equals 200 rUSD again.

This way, fee payments and staked SOURCE serve as monetary buffers that smooth the SOURCE supply and keep it primarily influenced by the size and transaction volume of the ReSource Network.
