# 4.3.1 rUSD on the Open Market

To optimize the monetary behavior of rUSD for the goals of the ReSource network, as well as to comply with regulatory guidelines, rUSD will not be traded on external exchanges and live solely within the confines of the ReSource network.

However, when utilized in jurisdictions that permit such trade, the ReSource Protocol provides means to expand the utility of its stablecoins and to generalize their value to exceed the confines of the protocol’s trading networks.

To achieve such a stable peg on the open market, the Reserve must utilize its SOURCE income to always offer 1 cUSD worth of SOURCE against one unit of its network’s stablecoin (in cases in which the stablecoin tracks the US Dollar). This creates an arbitrage opportunity in case the stablecoin price drops below its pegging target. On the other hand, if the stablecoin price rises above the targeted price, network members will be incentivized to deepen their debt positions and use the so-created network-stablecoins to purchase the tracked asset, driving the stablecoin’s price down toward its target price.

This arbitrage mechanism results in two income stream streams flowing into the Reserve: 1. Network-native stablecoins that have been acquired to maintain their peg, and 2. External stablecoins paid by network members to close their debt positions (in cases in which the price of the network’s stablecoin drops below its pegging target, creating conditions that would render this favorable for them). These income streams can then be used by the Reserve to further maintain the desired rUSD amount in circulation by either sterilizing reserved rUSD or recirculating it.
