# 4.4	SOURCE Token Dynamics

SOURCE is the governance token of the ReSource Protocol and will, as elaborated above, be used to underwrite debt accounts, and pay network fees. For an overview of the SOURCE token supply and distribution, please refer to the chapter titled “SOURCE Governance Token” below.

The chart below depicts the flow of SOURCE between the market and natural monetary sinks within the ReSource Network.

The ReSource Network consumes SOURCE through 1) the payment of fees by members, 2) staking requirements imposed on Underwriters. The ReSource Network emits SOURCE to the market via 1) staking rewards paid to Underwriters, and 2) the purchasing of rUSD to maintain its US dollar pegging target. Excess SOURCE that is not currently required to monetarily stabilize rUSD is sequestered within the network’s Reserve.
