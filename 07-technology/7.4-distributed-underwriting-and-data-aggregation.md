# 7.4 Distributed Underwriting and Data Aggregation

The role of risk assumption within the Resource protocol falls on network participants that assume the underwriter role. The Underwriting Application is a simple dApp that aggregates on/off chain data to derive a protocol-native credit score. In partnership with Teller Finance, we developed an underwriting algorithm responsible for deriving a network specific credit score.

The Underwriting dApp acts as a viewing window into the protocol where the underwriter can stake SOURCE, view financial data of businesses associated with each marketplace/network, create liquidity pools for specific aspects of a marketplace, track their Underwriter portfolio, delegate SOURCE to other underwriters, assume delegated SOURCE, and harvest rewards.
